Seabank House Strategic Plan - 2024 – 2028


1. Introduction

Seabank House has provided support and assistance for vulnerable adults with mental health issues for over one hundred years. The Charity, a non-profit making organisation, currently has two facilities – Seabank House, Dee Street, Aberdeen (19 rooms) and Aberlea House, St Swithin Street, Aberdeen (5 rooms) so can support a maximum of 24 resident on a 24-hour basis. These facilities are in Aberdeen city centre so supporting community connections and inclusion for residents. We base our care on the supported living principles – providing a safe and secure homely environment where residents are encouraged and assisted to live as independent a life as possible, so reaching their full potential.

The facilities are managed by a Project Manager who reports direct to the Chair of the Board.

Seabank House will continually improve and develop the service to meet changing needs, so providing positive and meaningful experiences for all our residents, supporting them to work towards their full potential.


Our Values - These guiding principles are at the core of what we do.

2. Context and Challenges

We recognise there are significant challenges within the Health and Social Care Sector nationally as we try as a nation to achieve the best mental health and wellbeing possible for all citizens. These external challenges have an impact on us locally as we

strive to meet challenging and more complex needs, recruit and retain suitable staff, maintain financial security, and provide strategic leadership.

On analysing our Charity and its operation, we acknowledge some of our internal strengths, challenges and opportunities. We are committed as a Board to step up to these challenges and have therefore developed strategic objectives and a yearly action plan to start addressing the opportunities and challenges, thereby reducing the threats.
